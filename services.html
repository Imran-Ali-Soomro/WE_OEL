              which in turn is a huge saving for the shipping lines as they do not incur any DOCK LABOR LEVIES.

            <p>
              Ideal Location : The terminal is located 43 kms away from the congested city of Karachi resulting in a 
              faster turnaround of the import and export cargoes and we have a separate truck holding area where in all 
              import and export trucks are queued and all necessary documentation completed prior to entry into the 
              terminal to expedite quick truck turnaround.

            <p>
              Hassle free documentation : With the introduction of WeBOC the whole clearance process has been Integrated 
              into one process which is virtually paper free. This has resulted in quicker truck turnaround , an absolute 
              one window operation and view speedy clearance of import boxes more space has been creatged in the terminal.

             hinterland markets supporting 70% of the country exports.  The 14km long rail siding within the terminal comprises 
             of 6 rail tracks that connect to the National railway grid. A large number of Multi National companies have opened
